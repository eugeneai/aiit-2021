  The research of the paper is devoted to present of an R\&D of a recommender system in carer guidance for Việt Nam middle school students.  The system is built on the base of John Holland's six personality types theory and collecting university students' opinions on their study conditions.  The RS relates new user (an entrant or a pupil) to a student group and then presents [[top-$N$]] universities/departments as a recommendation.  Techniques of overcoming ``cold start'' problem and other ones in this domain are considered.

  % This paper deals with mostly with the stage of information acquisition, correlation patterns construction and taxonomy construction for entrants and high school subjects.

\section{Introduction}

In the countries with predominantly young population, such as Việt Nam, the demand of young specialists is high.  While still a high school student, one have to make a decision about a career. Career choice depends on many factors such as personal interests, academic ability and employment opportunities available after the graduation.  Therefore, choosing the right carer is not an easy task.  In fact, quite often graduates remain unemployed for a long time or do not work in their specialties mastered in an educational institution.  This leads to inefficient use of state funds, their irrational distribution.  That's why the choice of an university after receiving a certificate of maturity is very important.  Choosing a suitable university results in an increase students' study productively, as they work and practice with enthusiasm.  Supporting the decision activities will give a better chance of achieving students' goals in the future.

In Tables 1 and 2, we present the result of interest assessment to career guidance and relevance of improving of the guidance system.  Tables show that there is a real problem of carer guidance and middle school students are very interested in improving the corresponding activities.

At present, with the development of the Internet, the search for information about universities is sufficiently efficient. However, having a huge amount of information, selecting substantive information is a difficult task.  Recommender systems (RS) have emerged as a decision support tool, providing users with the most useful and personalized variants for goods and services.  The functioning of RS is based on filtering information with respect to a set of known properties of objects and users.  For example, RSs are used to assess the users' preferences for goods and services (songs, films, video clips, books, articles, \emph{etc}.), which have been not previously given ratings by the user trying to make a choice.

RSs are also quite successfully used in many business spheres, such as entertainment: offering songs to listeners (\emph{e.g.}, the LastFM system -- www.last.fm), offering films (the Netflix system -- www.netflix.com), recommended videos (the YouTube system -- www.youtube.com); in education and training (learning resources, books, articles, site addresses), in intelligent systems of teacher assistants (predicting students' learning capabilities).  RSs are the field of active IT research since 2007.

Teaching experience of the first author of this paper in secondary school shows the relevance of the problem of choice of a profession.  This research, being the results of a master thesis, is dedicated to the development of an RS that allows students (applicants) to receive recommendations when taking career decisions.  The aim of the research is development of a RS for supporting students in their carer decision making.

The resulting RS prototype has two options for producing recommendations. The first one is realized on the base of John Holland theory \cite{holland}, according to which most people have one of six personality types.  After determining the type, a set of corresponding universities are produced.  The second one is an aggregation of questioning data about concrete universities obtained from students already being taught there.  The recommendations, then, are generated by means of collaborative filtration (CF) based on users' profile comparison.  Thus, the RS prototype combines two approaches: using expert knowledge and CF.

\section{Technique of construction for the RS helping with the carer choice}
\label{sec:base}

\emph{Recommender systems} \cite{rs_basics} are decision support information systems designed to assess the user's level of interest in a particular product or service (object) based on available information about user and object.  The RS development industry began to actively develop with the emergence of online sales services, and now it is one of the active areas of development of decision support systems, a direction of artificial intelligence, focused primarily on commercial use, as well as on solving problems of increasing the productivity of searching for relevant information.  A profession is the object of RS recommendation production.  Let us consider the development technique for RS construction from the point of view of solving the standard set problems and challenges.

Development of the RSs is aimed at solving the following set of problems \cite{ricci}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Increasing the sales of a product
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a number of commodities sold,
  \item organizing wider range product sales;
  \end{itemize}
\item Increasing user satisfaction and/or loyalty;
\item Better understanding user needs;
\item Better products offers with respect to the user needs;
\item Selection of sets of products for users with a common properties
  \begin{itemize}
  \item ``good'' ones, and
  \item product groups, having a common usability properties;
  \end{itemize}
\item Mining the classes of products, structuring the RS product domain, and
\item Generate a continuity of recommendations using the classification;
\item Rectifying user profile, \emph{e.g.} with targeted questioning;
\item For the users having no goal to make choice, but searching for an expert opinions,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Analysis of other users impact on a choice,
  \item Formalizing opinions,
  \item Recommending opinions.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
In this context, the RS is aimed at solving 4--7-th problems.  This set defines the methods of RS proposal generation and algorithms, which have to be implemented.  As we can see, the universities and their departments can be distributed on various carer directions by two ways: with the use of expert knowledge, when experts analyze a departments' properties and relate them to a direction, and with use of onions of the students (users who already ``consume'' a product).  In the second case, a good opinion of a user on a department (product) creates or solidifies a corresponding relation.  In the same time, a group of students positively characterized a department form a group of ``similar'' users.  % A new user, \emph{i.e.}, an enrollee of a middle school student, is to be tested with John Holland's theory to gain initial profile data.

The main problem solved during the R\&D is ``\emph{cold-start}'' \emph{problem}.  For RS based on CF, the similarity of user profiles in terms of sets of specified characteristics are performed. Content filtering RS compare products. In both cases, RS cannot generate recommendations if it does not have enough information about users or products.  The cold-start problem arises at the first stages of RS functioning and when a new user's behavior had not been observed sufficient time, \emph{i.e.}, the RS have no data about his preferences, or user's profile contains no useful information for a comparison.  The same situations arises for a new product, \emph{e.g.} there is no user bought the product, and no responses were given.  In this system explicit information collection has been realized for solving cold-start problem in CF, and John Holland's theory was used as initial profile data filling in, including the input data for the Holland's questionary.

The simplest technique for user profile data collection and usage is so called \emph{impersonalized acquisition}.  Recommendations are generated for an ``average'' user related to a nearest group od users.  An RS gives top-$N$ products for the group, efficiently ignoring personal preferences.  The approach can be developed to support personal data with construction of subgroups of the groups relating them to a set of personal characteristics.  This may lead to unwillingness giving personal data of users and impossibility to generate proposals when a user cardinally changes his/her preferences.  In this system, as our intention is a detection of a direction of a carer, impersonalized approach seems to give sufficient quality result.

The \emph{scalability problem}. Scalability is a property of software systems to be able to cope with the load prescribed by design, as well as with increased load if additional information--communication and computing resources are available.  For a simple RS with several users and products, there is no need to maintain scalability, and algorithms such as ``nearest-neighbor'' are widely used for assessing interests as the combinatorial space is not large. % TODO: SAY what algos used...

Thus, to construct carer choice RS prototype, we have chosen to collect impersonalized data, structure users with respect to their university/department preference and user profiles by means of collaborative filtering, use questionary and expert approach for initial user profile filling in.

% \section{Related works ????}

% \subsection{Entrants' RS}

% Functioning of an RS could be based on analysis of entrants' personal properties, matching them with already enrolled students, analyzing existing individual direction of training and even a particular educational program.  We have been developing and implementing a prototype RS for helping to choose a direction of training at a university for entrants on the base of algorithms for predicting their possible choice based on digital footprints in a social network. As a source data, \emph{e.g.}, subscriptions of Russian social network ``In Contact'' (IC) (in Russian -- ``В контакте'') are used as sources of personal characteristics, and enrollment orders of our university.  %The research \cite{c1} of Tomsk state university, Russia, shows that students (pupils) once or twice a year actualize their profile and subscriptions, as irrelevant information in the main tape (blog) results in necessity to routinely filtering it out. In 2016, the university researchers showed the IC profile in general actually reflects the cognitive properties of personality, and the educational interests of students are closely correlated to their social network behavior.

% Nowadays social networks are one of the main places of person's life, and even more so for a teenager.  This is clear from the data from the Glas Runet online poll service.  Among the 2000 participants of the survey, the majority (86\%) of them know about the existence of Internet social networks and use their services.  Among those who know about the existence of social networks, only 10\% do not use them \cite{c2}.
% The most popular social networks according to the Romir holding are Odnoklassniki, VKontakte and Instagram.  The youngest audience, from 14 to 30 years old, visits VKontakte, 45\% does it daily, and 70\% does more often than once a day \cite{c6}.

% Often, it is in social networks that one can track users' self-expression, interests and attitude to the world. The analysis of groups, posts on the main blog, reposts, statuses, \emph{etc.} can be the sources of the valuable information \cite{c7}.

% Of course, if a person is an adult, then it is unlikely that all subscriptions to groups will be relevant (``entered and forgot'').  But school students, according to research \cite{c11}, update subscriptions every six months or a year: irrelevant content in the feed annoys them.  Accordingly, subscriptions can become the original dataset that can be analyzed.

% In 2016, Tomsk State University researchers proved that the VKontakte profile reflects the cognitive personality traits, \emph{i.e.}, the educational interests of schoolchildren are closely related to their behavior in the social network \cite{c9}.

% %Based on the data on students enrolled in various areas of a university, it is possible to build a system of recommendations for the direction of training.

\subsection{Holland's six types TODO}

Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional. % Pages 27 of thesis

In order to determine the type one must answer 54 questions, the questions are evenly distributed on this six types.  For each question, a 0-4 scores are to be set depending on the degree of manifestation. The store 0 corresponds to ``no manifestation'' was mentioned of a kind, and score 4 denotes ``always manifestative''.  For each type the scores of the corresponding nine questions are collected, and the type is figured out as a type with the maximum score sum.  Student profiles store all answers and estimates, just for a further system development.

\section{Preliminary Data Processing}
\label{sec:relim-proc}


%\subsection{Input data acquisition}
%\label{sec:tech-input}

% The acquired input data stored in the database at first is processed with hierarchical cluster analysis algorithms to construct set of classes for students and study courses.  After that, a classification procedure is applied to construct relations between individual student to its class.  These classifications allow us to reduce the complexity of the main recommender algorithms and shift partially from collaborative filtration technique to ....

In realty RS, two program agents are implemented, which are executed on an event occurrence.  The first one starts by timer of web browser and implements issuing user positive evaluation, if user spends some time viewing a page of a realty object.  The second one, located at the server side, is activated if the first one raised event of a positive evaluation.  Server agent receives the evaluation and may start recalculation of estimates for recommendations if there are enough computational resources.

All data are stored in a database, which structure is represented as objects in Fig.~\ref{fig:class-siag}.  The central entity is \texttt{IOffer}, representing the offer of a realty object.  The information on an object, which is independent of an offer, is stored as \texttt{IObject}-object.  The object structure corresponds to standard Yandex and Google form of real estate representation.


\section{Database structure}


\section{Implementation}

The RS is a web-application implement in Django MVP\footnote{Abbreviation of Model-View-Controller programming pattern} framework, MySQL has been chosen for data storage.  Python programming language is the main glue subsystem, gathering web-application and recommender unit in one system.  For carrying out experiments with data, a Jupiter subsystem was included in the system as well.

User roles are administrators, anonymous and regular user.  Administrator can manipulate user accounts and any raw data.  Anonymous users can register, view information on universities, taught courses and professions.  Regular registered user can obtain recommendations, rate universities, add an university to his/her preference list.  The use-case diagram is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:use-case}.

\section{Web Applications}

\section{Related Works}

There are many research groups and commercial firms dealing with developing RS technologies for various domains.  We will consider related domains and other interesting cases.

In \cite{br22} a case-based reasoning RS for real estate market is presented.  Its goal is to find a similar instance in the database of existing cases, describing the cases for the user.  The obtained relations are used in followed collaborative filtration and content filtering.  In theoretical research \cite{br20} the users are divided on sellers and buyers.  Sellers ``advertise'' their realty by highlighting the important features by their opinion.  So the sellers play expert roles for forming data for content filtration.  Research \cite{br23} showed that usage of Internet does not influence significantly on the time efficiency, flexibility and satisfaction criteria of the search for a flat to buy.  There are no statistical difference between 2009 and 2011, since in 2011 88\% of buyers used Internet just as the main source of information.  Authors created RS with case based reasoning utilizing an ontology model.

In \cite{br23} authors highlight three key features which significantly affects the decision: location, housing unit properties and price.  Final decision is made after evaluation of the environment, such as distances to shops, kindergartens, schools.  This can be accounted reducing the additional data to the value of the feature of housing unit properties using ontology.  The environment constraint is entered by user: user draws a circle around the preferable location, which should contain interested services and realty.

Paper \cite{br21} considers a complex logistic problem of organization of a process of real estate control, involving various people group in changing business environment.  The main aim is to develop a model, where the groups will be maximally satisfied in a rational micro and macro environment.  The efficiency of the realty utilization is evaluated with criteria of market, ownership, renewal prices, capacity, number of operations to be done while ownership transferring, safety, comfort, the time of physical and technical exploitations, \emph{etc}.  The software functions shift from ``the most economically efficient control of the property'' to multicriterial choice, raising computation efficiency.

% TODO: review of entrants' RS.

For recent RS dealing with student's problem of choice the following papers were observed. In \cite{belotsky} an RS is constructed for helping entrants to choose an education direction (expressed as sets of corresponding high schools) according to his/her grades in GCE (General certificate of education), gained competing prizes, physical activity, and hobby.  Three methods of content filtration were implemented: by distances between vector characteristics, axiomatic method of Pareto-set contraction, and analysis of hierarchies.  Authors figured out coefficients relating study directions to the features of user using series of experimental assessments controlled by experts.

In \cite{bakh}, a problem of learning outcomes assessment of higher education students is considered.  A course RS on the base students' graduate attributes, which describe their developing values, is proposed.  RS rates improvement after each course and suggests new courses by a collaborative filtering algorithm in order to improve student's average competence profile.  Students are presented as long vectors of courses they already taken with the corresponding grades.  Similarity is calculated with a variation of angle cosine of the vectors.  The recommendations are the prediction of the grades for the new courses.  Similar by the problem statement paper \cite{amer}, where RS predicts course learning trajectory patterns, the students is suggested elective curses.  Source data for collaborative filtering are existing learning trajectories acquired from senior students in the image and likeliness one student advices younger one. Students and courses are divided on clusters.  For each student cluster (a group), mean values are calculated.  RS algorithms are based on combination of collaborative filtering and fuzzy-like rule based system, which defines process of production of a decision.  The article has a good reviews of related works and three classical approaches basics.

Work \cite{naren} has the similar aim to develop RS for advising students new courses, but is focusing on description of courses, taking advantage of natural language processing over course documents to acquire descriptions.  Feature descriptions contain formal course data (name, structure, lecturer) and a placement in a keyword appearance frequency space.  Existing student data, represented as grades of the courses he/she already got, related to the course data.  The resulting recommendations are represented as top-5 new courses, where student will gain the best grades.  This is a simplistic direct approach and, by authors opinion, gives good results; some measurement supporting the opinion were carried on.


% frvei of paper selection.

Interesting research has been done in \cite{br10}, where the problem of overcoming the cold start problem in recommending genres and music compositions, as well as movies.  The authors developed the RS ``EZSurf'' automating the process of web surfing and content filtering using a user profile on the social network ``VKontakte'', as well as API services \texttt{last.fm} and TheMovieDB, to obtain information about similarity of the objects.  This approach greatly simplifies storage of RS data, since it does not require the designing own system of classifications.  In \cite{br14}, a problem of choosing top--$N$ objects, with higher evaluations of user interest, in content filtration.  Authors proposed RS model based on fuzzy sets, RS quality assessment technique, and a corresponding algorithm.  The models have been tested on \texttt{last.fm} data.

In a comprehensive RS review dealing with text (scientific) document relevance grading \cite{br13}, authors noted that more than half (55\%, 34 of 62) RS were based on content filtration.  Collaborative filtration was used only in 18\% (11 of 62) cases.  Stereotype based and hybrid methods are also presented.  Authors concluded that 81\% in of cases modeling user does not produce significant results in comparison to explicit indication the set of keywords.  The papers were described by keywords and, less frequently, $N$--grams included in the text, as well as metadata such as authors and references.  Most popular recommending model is based on vector space approach.  User interest modeling is implemented with graphs, where vertices are the papers, and arcs are their relationships, and topic lists assigned to user by machine learning.  The topics are organized in hierarchical catalogs using ACM classifiers.  In the RS which used collaborative filtration, the explicit ratings was not collected at all as users were too lazy to supply a rating to a paper he/she looked through.  Implicit ratings were obtained by measuring the number of pages user read, document user interaction (loading, editing), co--loadings, co-view and co-citing by users of one group.

The collaborative filtration is currently more popular as it reflects practical experience: most of RS R\&D have to solve ``cold start'' problem of initial lack of information on objects and users, as well as have adaptation to user group interest transformations due to modern trends.

% TODO: Указать, в чем особенность наших двух проектов.
